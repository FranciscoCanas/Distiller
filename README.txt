=================

Keyword Extractor provides convenient auto-extraction of document key words
based on term-frequency/inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF), word
positioning, and other related features. 

Extractor handles all of the pre-processing details, and produces final
statistic reports in JSON format.

See the guide in docs for usage.
